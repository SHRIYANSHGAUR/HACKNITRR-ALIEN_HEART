# HACKNITRR-ALIEN_HEART
##We pitched-perfect the IDEA of No-Touch Revolution that we are in love with and are passionate about before the judges in all 3 Rounds , with the same intensity and excitement 
###To materialize our Idea I built a Desktop Native Computer Vision Application in python, using OpenCv and Mediapipe as dependencies.

##Our 1st Product was Air-Dribble-Canvas that allows user to draw on Computer Screen with the gestures of his fingers much like drawing in air in real time. It can also solves a major problem of the century i.e E-Waste generation as we are visualizing a new revolution that will eliminate any sort of hardware dependency required to write on screen.
##Our 2nd product was SMILE-DETECTOR , that is a Facial gesture recognition software which we will upgrade so that it can be used to solve problems related to mental health as constant sad expression can be then inferred as depression and anxiety.
we incorporated the suggestions of our Profound Judges during each round of evaluation and came up with a better version of our product !
##Our 3rd product was No-touch gaming in which we tried to automate our favourite game of Hill Climb racing.

#Used OpenCv to interact with webcam and converting images to numpy array of floats , flipping it over and drawing lines from previous coordinate to new one and much more!
#Used Mediapipe library to get the Face Mesh and hand mesh it provides .
##Then comes the analysis and logic building part where I had to make a list of data points , store their Ids , x-coordinate , y-coordinate as tuple and make the nessasery logical deductions to make smile-detector and air-dribble-canvas work!

#Challenges we faced and overcome :
##1) Deploying the application on heroku server for web- hosting ( This was not possible as told by Viren Khatri sir who was the judge of 1st round as the OpenCv application needs a CPU of atleast 2GB ram to function and heroku server was getting overloaded in an instant)
##2) Distribution we have planned to create an .exe file of our app using auto-py-to-exe package to make our application SCALABLE as a valuable suggestion we got from Kuldeep P. sir who was the judge of Final round.

#Future Scope:
##1)Add more gestures to facial gesture recognition app, and adding Z-index feature. 2) Making 3-D images using Air-Dribble Canavs like solidworks etc as asked by Kuldeep P. sir , Saket Kumar and Siddharth Shah sir our Judges of FINAL Round.
